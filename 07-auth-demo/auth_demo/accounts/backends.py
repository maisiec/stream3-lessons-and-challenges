		Get an instance of User using the supplied email and check its password
		"""

		Used by the django authentication sysytem to retrieve an instance of User
		"""

# Here we've created a class that will replace the standard 'auth'
# object that django uses to check logins and we override two of 
# its default methods. 

# This is actually not that different from the default method for
# testing against the username field. 
# Weâ€™ve simply swapped out the username field for the email field.
